#Using one or more .instructions.md files

#Create the .github/instructions directory if it does not already exist.

#Create one or more .instructions.md files, adding natural language instructions to the file(s).

#Whitespace between instructions is ignored, so the instructions can be written as a single paragraph, each on a new line, or separated by blank lines for legibility.

#Specify what files or directories the instructions apply to by adding applyTo frontmatter to the Markdown files, using glob syntax.

#---
#applyTo: "app/models/**/*.rb"
#---

#Add custom instructions here
#To apply the instructions to all files, use the ** pattern.
