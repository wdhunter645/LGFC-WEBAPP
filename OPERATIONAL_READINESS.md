## 🔧 Manual Operations

### Required Repository Secrets

The following secrets must be configured in GitHub repository settings for workflows to function properly:

#### Supabase Configuration
- **`SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`**: Personal access token for Supabase CLI authentication
- **`SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`**: Project reference ID for linking to the correct Supabase project
  - Current project ref: `vkwhrbjkdznncjkzkiuo`

#### Setup Instructions
1. Go to Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add the required secrets with appropriate values
3. Verify workflow functionality by triggering manual runs

### Updating Schema Baseline
When legitimate schema changes are made:
```bash
# Trigger workflow manually to update baseline
gh workflow run schema-drift-detection.yml
```

### Manual Health Check
For immediate health assessment:
```bash
# Trigger workflow manually
gh workflow run health-checks.yml
```

### Emergency Security Scan
For immediate security assessment:
```bash
# Trigger workflow manually
gh workflow run security-scans.yml
```

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
