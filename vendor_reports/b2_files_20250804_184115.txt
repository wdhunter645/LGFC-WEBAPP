b2 ls [-h] [-l] [--json] [--replication] [--versions] [-r] [--with-wildcard]
      [--include FILTERS] [--exclude FILTERS]
      [B2_URI]

  List files in a given folder.

  Using the file naming convention that / separates folder names from their
  contents, returns a list of the files and folders in a given folder. If no
  folder name is given, lists all files at the top level.

  The --long option produces very wide multi-column output showing the upload
  date/time, file size, file id, whether it is an uploaded file or the hiding
  of a file, and the file name. Folders don't really exist in B2, so folders
  are shown with - in each of the fields other than the name.

  The --json option produces machine-readable output similar to the server api
  response format.

  The --replication option adds replication status

  The --versions option selects all versions of each file, not just the most
  recent.

  The --recursive option will descend into folders, and will select only files,
  not folders.

  The --with-wildcard option will allow using *, ? and `[]` characters in
  folderName as a greedy wildcard, single character wildcard and range of
  characters. It requires the --recursive option. Remember to quote folderName
  to avoid shell expansion.

  The --include and --exclude flags can be used to filter the files returned
  from the server using wildcards. You can specify multiple --include and
  --exclude filters. The order of filters matters. The [3mlast[0m matching filter
  decides whether a file is included or excluded. If the given list of filters
  contains only INCLUDE filters, then it is assumed that all files are
  excluded by default.

  Examples

  [1mNote[0m

    Note the use of quotes, to ensure that special characters are not expanded
    by the shell.

  List csv and tsv files (in any directory, in the whole bucket):

  b2 ls --recursive --with-wildcard "b2://bucketName/*.[ct]sv"

  List all info.txt files from directories named b?, where ? is any character:

  b2 ls --recursive --with-wildcard "b2://bucketName/b?/info.txt"

  List all pdf files from directories b0 to b9 (including sub-directories):

  b2 ls --recursive --with-wildcard "b2://bucketName/b[0-9]/*.pdf"

  List all buckets:

  b2 ls

  Requires capability:

    â€¢ [1mlistFiles[0m
    â€¢ [1mlistBuckets[0m (if bucket name is not provided)

positional arguments:
  B2_URI             B2 URI pointing to a bucket, directory, file or all buckets. e.g. b2://yourBucket, b2://yourBucket/file.txt, b2://yourBucket/folderName/, b2id://fileId, or b2://

  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -l, --long
