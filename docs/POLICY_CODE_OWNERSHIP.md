# Code Ownership Policy

- Cursor Agent (`@GehrigFanClub`) is the designated owner for all Dev & Ops code in this environment.
- Ownership is enforced via `.github/CODEOWNERS` with `@GehrigFanClub` listed for key paths.
- Branch protection for `main` should enable "Require review from Code Owners" to guarantee review by Cursor Agent.
- When multiple owners are listed (e.g., `@wdhunter645 @GehrigFanClub`), either may review; Cursor Agent remains accountable for automation-driven changes.
- Update this policy if ownership changes; keep `.github/CODEOWNERS` in sync.
