# Activity Log — 2025-08-18

- Date/Time: 2025-08-18 14:45 ET (18:45 UTC)
- Participants/Owners: @wdhunter645, background agent
- Session Goal: Restore context after archived threads; set up Dev/Ops automation and ownership

## Changes Made
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` — add `@wdhunter645 @gehrigfanclub` as owners; cover workflows, ops, src, app, packages
- `docs/session-logs/2025-08-18-monday0818.md` — add session log, wrap-up, next-session checklist
- Verified workflows: `dev-bot.yml`, `dev-bot-daily-plan.yml`, `ops-bot.yml`, `ops-bot-daily-report.yml`, `dev-ops-create-issue.yml`

## Why
- Archived Cursor sessions on iPad drop ephemeral context; persist operational state in repo
- Ensure code ownership and review enforcement via branch protection + CODEOWNERS

## Decisions
- Decision: Use GitHub Actions for Dev/Ops bot triggers (dispatch + 06:00 ET schedules)
- Decision: Track session handoff context in `docs/session-logs/` and `docs/activity-log/`

## Next
- Next: Open PR from `cursor/monday0818-background-task-1b3e` to `main` for CODEOWNERS and logs
- Next: Enable "Require review from Code Owners" in branch protection for `main`
- Next: Manually dispatch Dev/Ops daily workflows once to validate behavior

## Risks/Blockers
- Risk: Schedules depend on GitHub cron + time gating; missed runs without manual dispatch

## Rollback Plan
- Revert CODEOWNERS or adjust path owners via PR if ownership becomes too restrictive
