## ðŸ”— Supabase Integration

- **Anon Key:** Managed securely in environment variables
- **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Enabled and actively enforced via SQL policies
- **Access Rules:**
  - Public users can view only approved content
  - Authenticated users can submit, update, and manage their own content

---

## ðŸ“¦ Deployment Workflow

- Updates made in GitHub are deployed via GitHub commits and pushed directly to this repo
- Supabase schema changes are backed up manually in `/supabase/schema/` with date-based filenames
- GitHub serves as the source of truth for version control and disaster recovery

---

## âœ… Best Practices (In Progress)

- Manual Supabase schema export after significant changes
- GitHub-first development model
- Add GitHub Actions to automate backups (future)
- Add UI testing / preview support (future)

---

## ðŸ§­ Project Status

Development is actively in progress. The focus for **July 2025** includes:

- Frontend testing through GitHub
- Schema stability and RLS security
- Connecting user-generated content to display layers
- Preparing for public preview and community feedback
