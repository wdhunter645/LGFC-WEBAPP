# ⚾ LGFC-WEBAPP: Lou Gehrig Fan Club Web Application

This repository contains the source code and schema for the **Lou Gehrig Fan Club** web application, currently under development using **GitHub** (frontend) and **Supabase** (backend).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Frontend:** Built with [GitHub](https://github.com) and Astro, a modern static site framework
- **Backend:** Managed with [Supabase](https://supabase.com) — includes authentication, database, and REST API
- **Hosting & Deployment:** Code changes are committed and version-controlled through GitHub, deployed via Netlify

## 🔧 Branch Management System

This repository includes a comprehensive branch audit and cleanup system to maintain repository health:

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Perform branch audit (firewall-safe)
node scripts/git_branch_audit.mjs audit

# Generate cleanup script
node scripts/git_branch_audit.mjs cleanup

# Check repository health
./scripts/git_health_check.sh check
```

### Automated Maintenance
- **Weekly Audits**: Automated branch analysis every Monday at 6 AM UTC
- **Smart Cleanup**: Automatically categorizes branches as DELETE, REVIEW, MERGE, or KEEP
- **Safety Features**: Backup procedures and confirmation requirements
- **GitHub Integration**: Automated reporting and issue creation

### ⚠️ Workflow Ordering Requirements

**IMPORTANT for Maintainers**: When creating or modifying GitHub Actions workflows that need API access:

1. **Branch Audit First**: Always run branch audit steps BEFORE other setup steps:
   ```yaml
   steps:
     - name: Checkout repository
     - name: Perform Branch Audit (Before Firewall)  # ← Must be early
     - name: Setup Node.js                           # ← After audit
     - name: Install dependencies                    # ← After audit
   ```

2. **API Access Requirements**: 
   - Use `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authenticated operations
   - GitHub Actions firewall may block direct API calls after certain setup steps
   - The branch audit system uses firewall-safe git commands and GitHub CLI

3. **Troubleshooting Firewall Issues**:
   - If you see "GitHub API request failed", check workflow step order
   - The system automatically falls back to git commands if API access is blocked
   - See `BRANCH_AUDIT_DOCUMENTATION.md` for detailed troubleshooting

See [BRANCH_AUDIT_DOCUMENTATION.md](./BRANCH_AUDIT_DOCUMENTATION.md) for complete usage guide and firewall troubleshooting.

## Running Tests

To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

---

## 🔗 Supabase Integration

- **Anon Key:** Managed securely in environment variables
- **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Enabled and actively enforced via SQL policies
- **Access Rules:**
  - Public users can view only approved content
  - Authenticated users can submit, update, and manage their own content

---

## 📦 Deployment Workflow

- Updates made in GitHub are deployed via GitHub commits and pushed directly to this repo
- Supabase schema changes are backed up manually in `/supabase/schema/` with date-based filenames
- GitHub serves as the source of truth for version control and disaster recovery

---

## ✅ Best Practices (In Progress)

- Manual Supabase schema export after significant changes
- GitHub-first development model
- Automated branch management and cleanup
- Repository health monitoring
- **Workflow Ordering**: API-dependent steps before firewall activation
- Add UI testing / preview support (future)

---

## 🧭 Project Status

Development is actively in progress. The focus for **August 2025** includes:

- Frontend testing through GitHub
- Schema stability and RLS security
- Connecting user-generated content to display layers
- Repository maintenance automation (✅ **COMPLETED**)
- Branch audit and cleanup system (✅ **FIREWALL-SAFE**)
- Preparing for public preview and community feedback
