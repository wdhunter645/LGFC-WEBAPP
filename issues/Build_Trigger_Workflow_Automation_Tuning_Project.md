# ðŸš€ Build Trigger & Workflow Automation Tuning Project

## Project Overview
This project will capture all topics and action items related to tuning build triggers and workflow automation to optimize resource usage, specifically targeting Netlify build minutes and CI/CD overhead.

## Goals
- Reduce unnecessary build volume due to high-frequency PRs and bot activity.
- Tune Netlify and GitHub Actions triggers to only run builds on main branches and when necessary.
- Audit and refine build and deploy workflows for optimal performance.
- Document process improvements and decisions.

## Key Topics to Review & Implement
- Netlify build trigger configuration (main branches, manual deploy previews, bot PR filtering)
- GitHub Actions workflow trigger tuning
- Bot activity scheduling and batching
- Monitoring build volume and identifying root causes of overages
- Incident response procedures for build failures and quota breaches
- Monthly reporting on build health and optimization metrics
- Escalation and support paths for workflow failures

## Next Steps
- Review current Netlify and GitHub workflow settings
- Identify immediate changes to reduce build frequency
- Assign tasks for research and implementation
- Schedule periodic review and optimization sessions
